The algorithms must be  **==precises==** , Must say the steps to follow.
Must be ==defined==, Following an algorithm several times should give the same result.
Must be finite, In some time must stop.

Parts of an algorithm
- Entry - Input---Is the part of the algorithm collet the data for the proccesing. Can be given from the user or collected  by the algorithm itself.

- Process - Course---It is the set of operations or instructions that the algorithm executes with the input to transform it and arrive at the solution.

- Output---These are the results the algorithm produces after processing the input. The output is the solution to the problem or task the algorithm was designed to perform.
						An algorithm must have at least one output, otherwise it would be meaningless.
