Types of Expressions

Expressions can be classified into different types, depending on the operators they use and the type of value they produce:

Arithmetic expressions: Perform mathematical calculations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **).

String expressions: Perform operations on text strings (concatenation +, formatting).

Relational expressions: Compare values ​​(= =, !=, >, <, >=, <=).

Logical expressions: Perform logical operations (and, or, not).

Expressions are a fundamental component of computer programs. They are used to perform calculations, make decisions, manipulate data, and control the flow of program execution.
