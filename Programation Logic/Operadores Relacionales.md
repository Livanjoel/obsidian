a > b Greater than, a greater than b
a < b Less than, a less than b
a >= b Greater than or equal to, a greater than or equal to b
a <= b Less than or equal to, a less than or equal to b
a == b Equal to, a is equal to b
a != b Not equal to, a is not equal to b

Examples

```
a > b "a=10,b=2" 
```

```
a < b "a=10,b=11"
```

```
a >= b "a=(10.....),b=10" 
```

```
a <= b "a=(.....10),b=10"
```

```
a == b "a=10,b=10"
```

```
a != b "a=(2,1,-3,100),b=10"
```
