Here are some examples to illustrate how the simple rule of three and the compound rule of three work:
Simple Rule of Three

Example 1: Direct
Problem: If 5 pencils cost $10, how much will 12 pencils cost?
Solution:
Let's set up the proportion: 5 pencils / $10 = 12 pencils / x
Let's solve for x: x = (12 pencils * $10) / 5 pencils
Let's calculate: x = $24
Answer: 12 pencils will cost $24.

Example 2: Inverse
Problem: If it takes 3 workers 20 days to build a wall, how long will it take 5 workers to build the same wall?
Solution:
We establish the inverse relationship: 3 workers * 20 days = 5 workers * x
We solve for x: x = (3 workers * 20 days) / 5 workers
We calculate: x = 12 days
Answer: 5 workers will take 12 days.
Compound Rule of Three

Example 3:
Problem: If 8 workers, working 6 hours a day for 10 days, build a 120-meter wall, how many days will it take 10 workers, working 8 hours a day, to build a 150-meter wall?
Solution:
Let's organize the data:
Workers: 8 / 10
Hours/day: 6 / 8
Days: 10 / x
Meters: 120 / 150
Let's set up the equation:
(8 workers / 10 workers) * (6 hours/day / 8 hours/day) * (10 days / x) = 120 meters / 150 meters
Let's solve for x:
x = (10 days * 10 workers * 8 hours/day * 150 meters) / (8 workers * 6 hours/day * 120 meters)
Let's calculate: x = 15,625 days
Answer: It will take 15,625 days
